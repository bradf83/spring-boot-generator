# Spring Boot Generator (WORK IN PROGRESS)

A simple Spring Boot application that generates code in the standard pattern that I use.

## How does it work?

1. First you define your model and your package structure and then hit generate
2. It then creates the basic model, repository, service and controller for you

## Assumptions

1. Currently this project assumes that you have the extension classes, this will change in the future.
2. There are other various code assumptions based on the standard pattern that I use.
3. Currently built for Spring Boot 1.4

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Start it up
3. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/ and let the generating begin.

## TODO

1. Parameterize the generation location.
2. Timestamp the folder for generation.
3. Prevent double submits
